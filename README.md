# About Lumino

Lumino is a project whose idea belonged to a friend of mine, @TheNitroxone, which he allowed me to take over as part of my React.js apprenticeship. It's a blog about video games and new technologies, with a clean, modern design.

## To-do list

- Main components appearance, structure, and work on UI.
- Users' logic, sign-in/up, profile...
- Article operations: creation, deletion, editing, etc.
- Halos (which will be extremly difficult)
